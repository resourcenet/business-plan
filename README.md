A plan of action for resource net.

Hey guys, I'm new to git and opensource software, but I think the concept is amazing and I'd like to try and employ its power to creat an opensourced and publically owned social network, dedicated to people just making everything better for everyone.

We also hope to film and document this journey in a way that has never been done before and we're excited about the possibility.

I'm sure you've heard all this before, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to have a go.

Any advice would be greatly apreciated...

Lets see where this goes!
