{"body":"# Welcome to the resource-net business-plan wiki!\r\n\r\n**We're looking for people to join our mission to create a new generation of social media.**\r\n\r\n_I just found GitHub last night, after a crazy week/insane night and have been busy looking into it since then._\r\n\r\n_It's now 11pm in New Zealand, and I'm fighting to stay awake as I'm so excited about a tool like GitHub._\r\n\r\n\r\nSo some crazy dreams, and working back from there.\r\n\r\nWe found an island for sale in our beautiful home country New Zealand.\r\n\r\n![Development Hub](http://www.resource.net.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/pakatoa_web.jpg)\r\n\r\nOur plan is to crowd fund the acquisition of this island, as well as setting up: \r\n* Development servers, \r\n* Sustainable energy systems, \r\n* Gardens, \r\n* RnD rooms, \r\n* Recording studio, \r\n* Workshop,\r\n* Media facilities.\r\n\r\nThe primary function of this island is to house professionals, innovators and facilitators of collaborative projects that simply make things better for as many people as possible, in the most efficient way.\r\n\r\nWhile working in collaborative work environments, participants can regularly meet with developers, interface designers and information scientists. (I'm just throwing round words that appeal to me)\r\n\r\nThis is how we build the functions of our social network!\r\n\r\nWe'd like to build a business model around this so this project can be completely self sustainable and procreative. Looking for ways to make all facets of our network more efficient, healthier and more accessible to those in our network and their wider communities.\r\n\r\nThis business/ project plan will be developed completely transparently with open-source methods, and forks of plan can be made to suit different business and project scenarios.\r\n\r\nWe're a small creative team from New Zealand, a bunch of mates sharing one bank account a couple of firetrucks to realize our dream of documenting the next generation of social media.\r\n\r\nJust over a year ago I met a dude called Mark, we started a \"media company\", [Adventure Artists](http://www.adventureartists.co.nz)\r\nThen we opened a wee office amongst another cool project: [Falling Apple](http://www.humsalon.co.nz/)\r\nabout a week after that, we tattooed our logo on our asses, told everyone we were media company and talked our way into getting sponsored to meet one of New Zealand's biggest bands, Shapeshifter on their tour of Europe.\r\n\r\nWe had never made a video, but we got one way tickets to the UK, and made our first video on the plane to meet them.\r\n\r\nWe got to the UK with Â£20 between the 2 of us, no visas, no return tickets and no travel insurance.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, shit got crazy, and after eventually traveling through and filming around 10 countries, we lost our laptop, hard drive and my passport.\r\n\r\nDown but not out, we hitched back to the UK to randomly live endup a castle attending a regenerative agriculture workshop hosted by the legendary Darren Doherty. In fact, this time last year I spent a few week alone in this place:\r\n![Castle Crashing](http://www.resource.net.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/unoyear_1337.jpg)\r\nspending lonely nights learning about websites through my iphone, and eating tomato sauce and mustard sandwiches for most meals.\r\n\r\nWe finally made it home, and launched back with full force. Since then we've been on TV, got sponsored by Nikon and made about 70 videos working with a number of amazing people.\r\n\r\nOur team has grown to 5 full timers, with around 30 rapidly becoming more involved.\r\n\r\nAs we learned to film and edit on the road and in our own manor, we believe we have a new way of operating, and can bring a number of projects into this network while we actively travel the world, meeting people, introducing themselves and their projects on our very own social network, I hope we can kick off from right here.\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant, I'll be updating this regularly.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone else will see the vision.\r\n\r\nLove you guys!!\r\nNate.","tagline":"An intro to Resource Net","note":"Don't delete this file!
